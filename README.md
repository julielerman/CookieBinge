EF Core 1.1 Sqlite in UWP App
This is an updated version of a sample app I originally did with Winphone 8, EF7 (early alpha of what is now EF Core) and Sqlite.
I've moved it to be on UWP. EF does what it's supposed to do which is the most important. It looks ok on a phone but it doesn't resize properly for larger devices. I'll get back to sorting that out.
This is part of my Pluralsight EF Core: Getting Started course which should be ready in January 2017.
